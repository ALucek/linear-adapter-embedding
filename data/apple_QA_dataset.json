We\u2019ve \ncrossed key milestones on our environmental journey. And we\u2019re \nrising to the generational challenge of climate change by working \nwith companies and communities that span the globe.\nApple 2030 is our commitment to be carbon neutral for our entire \nfootprint by the end of the decade. We\u2019ll get there by  innovating  \nat every stage of the product lifecycle \u2014 from how they\u2019re  made,  \nto what they\u2019re made  from.\nThat starts with bringing new clean energy online across our supply \nchain. Today, more than 320 suppliers have committed to using \nrenewable electricity for Apple production. With over 16 gigawatts \nalready online, they\u2019re avoiding more than 18 m illion metric  tons  \nof greenhouse gas emissions.\nOur teams and suppliers are a part of so many  communities,  \nso Apple\u2019s work to protect the planet takes us around the world. That\u2019s why we\u2019re partnering directly with communities and local \norganizations to support environmental solutions where they\u2019re \nneeded most. In 2023, that meant expanding our Power for Impact \nprogram to bring clean energy to underserved communities  in  \nNepal and Colombia, and supporting programs that  increase  \naccess to safe water and sanitation in India.\nWe\u2019re also building our products with more recycled and renewable \nmaterial than ever \u2014 work that helps to drive down our carbon \nfootprint. Our customers play an important role in this  effort.  \nWhen you participate in the Apple Trade-In program, you\u2019re helping \nto bring us closer to the day our products will be made without \ntaking anything from the Earth.\nThe proof is in our products. Last year, more than 20 percent  of \nthe materials we shipped in Apple products came from recycled \nsources. MacBook Air is our first product made with more than \n50 percent  recycled material, and we\u2019re making important strides \nacross all of our products.

As part of our efforts \nto achieve carbon neutrality across our value chain, \nApple prioritizes emissions reductions. We then \nbalance the remaining unavoidable emissions with \nhigh-quality carbon removal credits. To ensure that \nremovals are high integrity, we follow guidance set \nout by international standards and apply our own \nrigorous standards and criteria.\nNature-based carbon  removal\nScience indicates that nature-based solutions \nare the most scalable and economically viable \nopportunities to mitigate climate change in the short \nterm. In addition to their climate benefits, nature-\nbased solutions offer multiple co-benefits, including \nenhanced employment and local livelihoods, \nimproved biodiversity, soil carbon and nutrient \ncycling, and increased timber supply that can reduce \nthe pressure on primary  forests.\nThe IPCC lays out a range of options to remove \ncarbon from the atmosphere using a combination \nof\u00a0photosynthesis and chemistry. These approaches \ninclude existing climate solutions, such as \nafforestation and reforestation, and relatively new technologies, such as direct air capture (DAC) \nand ocean alkalinization. Apple looked at how \nthese approaches could help balance our residual \nemissions as we focus on the global urgency to align \nwith a 1.5\u00b0 C pathway to scale up carbon  removal. \nFive key criteria drive our exploration:\n\u2022 Stage of development:  A solution\u2019s stage of \ndevelopment is important both to meet our Apple \n2030 target and to reach scale within the time \nframe needed to stay within a 1.5\u00b0 C  trajectory. \n\u2022 Scalability: We consider scalability because the \nclimate crisis is a collective responsibility, and the \nimpact of Apple\u2019s solutions should scale  beyond  \nour own environmental  footprint. \n\u2022 Durability:  Removals must be permanent, or if \nthere\u2019s a risk of reversal, measures must be in place \nto address those risks and compensate for any \nreversals for a defined period of  time. \n\u2022 Carbon methodology: \u00a0The impacts achieved \nneed to be accounted for through using a rigorous \ncarbon accounting methodology that aligns \nwith quality and consistency of our own carbon \naccounting systems, including evaluating any \nuncertainty in the underlying  science. \n\u2022 Co-benefits: We evaluated the co-benefits  \nacross different carbon removal  technologies.  \nMost carbon removal approaches have the potential \nto generate additional benefits for  biodiversity  \nand communities but can also pose  risks.Our review of different available technologies helped \nus determine that nature-based solutions\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including \nafforestation, reforestation, and revegetation (ARR) \nand soil carbon sequestration\u00a0\u2014 currently offer the \nmost comprehensive carbon removal  approach.\nRestore  Fund\nWe launched the Restore Fund in 2019 in partnership \nwith Conservation International and Goldman Sachs. \nSince its creation, the fund has invested in three \ninitiatives that are projected to remove over a million",

Daisy can \ndisassemble up to 1. 2 million phones each year, \nhelping us recover more valuable materials for \nrecycling. From just one metric ton of iPhone main \nlogic boards, flexes, and camera modules recovered \nby Daisy, our recycling partner can recover the same \namount of gold and copper as can be obtained from \nmore than 2, 000 m etric tons of mined rock.68 The \nU.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued Apple \nfive patents related to Daisy, and we\u2019re willing to \nlicense these to researchers and other electronics \nmanufacturers who are developing their own \ndisassembly processes in hopes that they will follow \nsuit and work to increase the share of recycled \nmaterials in the supply chain.69Taz:  Helps recycle modules by separating magnets \ncontaining rare earth elements from audio modules. \nWhile rare earth elements are typically lost in \nconventional shredders, Taz is designed to access \nthese valuable materials, improving our overall \nrecovery rate.

We used a 1978 federal \nlaw called the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act \n(PURPA) to structure the project. We then applied \nthis same structure to two more large solar PV and \nbiogas fuel cell projects in North Carolina and two \nmicrohydro projects in Oregon. This was a landmark \nmoment in corporate renewable energy development \nand led to an increased use of PURPA in these  states.\n2012  \nDirect Access: \u00a0In California and Oregon, we\u2019ve \nused a program called Direct Access to bypass the \ndefault electricity generation offered by the utilities \nservicing our data centers in those states. Instead, \nwe contracted directly with independent power \nproducers and electricity service providers who \ncould supply 100 percent  renewable electricity. After \ninitially buying from existing, third-party-owned \nprojects, we\u2019re now procuring renewable energy from \nprojects we created: The Solar Star II and Montague \nWind projects deliver renewables to our Oregon data \ncenter, and the California Flats solar project delivers \nrenewables to our data centers, offices, and retail \nstores in California.2013  \nGreenEnergy Rider: \u00a0We opened a new data center \nin Reno, Nevada. With no PURPA or Direct Access \noptions in Nevada, we worked directly with the local \nutility, NV Energy, to create a whole new regulatory \nstructure.

We used a 1978 federal \nlaw called the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act \n(PURPA) to structure the project. We then applied \nthis same structure to two more large solar PV and \nbiogas fuel cell projects in North Carolina and two \nmicrohydro projects in Oregon. This was a landmark \nmoment in corporate renewable energy development \nand led to an increased use of PURPA in these  states.\n2012  \nDirect Access: \u00a0In California and Oregon, we\u2019ve \nused a program called Direct Access to bypass the \ndefault electricity generation offered by the utilities \nservicing our data centers in those states. Instead, \nwe contracted directly with independent power \nproducers and electricity service providers who \ncould supply 100 percent  renewable electricity. After \ninitially buying from existing, third-party-owned \nprojects, we\u2019re now procuring renewable energy from \nprojects we created: The Solar Star II and Montague \nWind projects deliver renewables to our Oregon data \ncenter, and the California Flats solar project delivers \nrenewables to our data centers, offices, and retail \nstores in California.2013  \nGreenEnergy Rider: \u00a0We opened a new data center \nin Reno, Nevada. With no PURPA or Direct Access \noptions in Nevada, we worked directly with the local \nutility, NV Energy, to create a whole new regulatory \nstructure. The Nevada GreenEnergy Rider enables \nus to secure a long-term, fixed-price contract for \nrenewable electricity from a new solar PV project \nbuilt for us\u00a0but managed by the utility. We\u2019ve used \nthis partnership to create four solar projects totaling \n320 megawatts.\n2014  \nEquity investment: \u00a0We invested in two 20-megawatt \nsolar PV projects in Sichuan, China, to support \nall\u00a0our in-country retail stores, corporate offices, \nand data storage facilities. This project represented \nthe first time a commercial company created a new \nlarge-scale project in China for its own use. We\u2019ve \nsince replicated this model many times for Apple\u2019s \nsupply  chain.2015 & 2016  \nPortfolio solutions: \u00a0We adapted to land scarcity \nconstraints in Singapore and Japan by contracting \nfor solar PV on 800 rooftops in Singapore and 300 \nin Japan. We adapted our approach in each country \nto fit local partnerships and regulatory structures: \nWe signed a long-term agreement similar to a power \npurchase agreement in Singapore and made an \nequity investment in Japan.

For the purposes of our \nassessment, years of use, which are \nbased on first owners, are modeled to \nbe four years for macOS, visionOS, and \ntvOS devices and three years for iOS, \niPadOS, and watchOS devices. Most \nApple products last longer and are often \npassed along, resold, or returned to \nApple by the first owner for others to \nuse. More information on our product \nenergy use is provided in our Product \nEnvironmental  Reports.To model end of life\nWe use material composition data \non our products and estimate the \nratio of products that are sent to \nrecycling or disposal. For products \nsent to recycling, we capture the \ninitial processing by the recycler to \nprepare the product for recovery \nof electronic, metal, plastic, and \nglass material streams. Subsequent \ndownstream recycling processes are \nnot included, as these are considered \nstages of production and not end-of-\nlife processing. For products sent to \ndisposal, we capture the emissions \nassociated with landfilling or \nincineration of each type of material.Putting it all together\nAfter we collect data about \nmanufacturing, use, transportation, \nand end of life, we combine it with \ndetailed greenhouse gas emission \ndata. This emission data is based \non a combination of Apple-specific \nand industry-average data sets for \nmaterial production, manufacturing \nprocesses, electricity generation, and \ntransportation. Renewable energy \nused in the supply chain, initiated by \nsuppliers independently or through \nthe Apple Supplier Clean Energy \nProgram, is also accounted for within \nthe LCA model. Combining product-\nspecific information with emission \ndata in our LCA allows us to compile \ndetailed results for greenhouse gas \nemissions as they relate to each \nproduct.

The scope of the fiber and plastic \npackaging footprint  includes Apple\u2019s corporate packaging fiber and plastic usage from \nproducts , retail operations and Apple care services . The packaging fiber and plastic  \nfootprint  tracks the total amount of plastic, vi rgin and recycled wood fibre , that Apple  uses \nin packaging. Apple  obtain s and analyses  supplier -specific data for each product line and \nsums up these figures for the entire  company using sell -in numbers.  For some products, a \nrepresentative supplier is chos en to calculate the product -specifc packaging. The output is a \ntotal packag ing fiber and plastic  footprint.  For labels, beats products and accessories, \nindividual sell -in numbers were only availabe for a share of product s. These were  \nextrapolated for the w hole category. ESD packages (within Apple care) are excluded from \nthe packaging plastic footprint.   \nThe review of the corporate annual packaging fiber and plastic  footprint has considered the \nfollowing criteria:  \n\uf0a7 The system boundaries are clearly defined  \n\uf0a7 Assumptions and estimations made are app ropriate  \n\uf0a7 Use of supplier  data is appropriate and methodologies used are adequately \ndisclosed  \nData reported by Apple is as follows:   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Corporate  Packaging Fiber and Plastic  Footprint  \nReview  \nClient: Apple Inc. 2 2023 Total  Virgin  Recycled  \nPlastic  w/o \nadhesives  6,400 6,400 --  \nFiber  247,900 89,500 158,4 00 \n [metric tons ] [metric tons plastic ] [metric tons plastic]  \n \nAll results and figures reviewed for fiscal year 20 23 are plausible.  \n \n2 Reviewed Data and Findings  \nAs part of this review Apple disclosed following data to Fraunhofer IZM:   \n\uf0a7 Calculation m ethodology for the c orporate  packaging fiber and plastic  footprint  \n\uf0a7 Sales data for FY202 3, including accessories",

The GHG Protocol currently defines scope 1 emissions \nas direct greenhouse gas emissions that occur from sources that \nare owned or controlled by the company; scope 2 emissions as \nthe indirect greenhouse gas emissions from the generation of \npurchased electricity, steam, heat, and cooling consumed by the \ncompany; and scope 3 emissions as all \u201cother indirect emissions\u201d \nthat occur in the value chain of the reporting company, including \nboth upstream and downstream emissions. Apple currently sets an \noperational boundary for its emissions and excludes the following \nscope 3 categories, as defined by the GHG Protocol, which \ncollectively make up less than 10 percent  of our 2015 base year \nscope 3 emissions currently: \u201ccapital goods\u201d due to limited data \navailability, which limits our ability to influence these emissions, and \n\u201cwaste generated in operations,\u201d as these emissions are negligible. \nThe following subset of greenhouse gas categories recognized \nin the Kyoto Protocol are included: carbon dioxide (CO 2), \nmethane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), \nperfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6), Nitrogen \ntrifluoride  (NF 3).\n2 Carbon reductions are calculated against a baseline scenario: 1) No \nuse of clean electricity for manufacturing or product use, beyond \nwhat is already available on the grid (based on regional emissions \nfactors). 2) Apple\u2019s carbon intensity of key materials as of 2015 \n(our baseline year for our 2030 product carbon neutrality goal). \nCarbon intensity of materials reflects use of recycled content and \nproduction technology. 3) Apple\u2019s average mix of transportation \nmodes (air, rail, ocean, ground) by product line across three \nyears (fiscal years 2017 to 2019) to best capture the baseline \ntransportation emissions of our products.\n3 As of product launch, 50 percent  of all low-carbon watch \nproducts by weight are planned to be shipped via non-air modes \nof transportation over the lifetime of the products from our final \nassembly sites to their next destination \u2014 primarily regional \ndistribution  hubs.\n4  Apple reports data about the recycled content of its products at \ndifferent levels of fidelity, based on the level of independent data \nverification. The bulk of Apple\u2019s recycled content data is certified \nand thus verified by a third party. Less than 3 percent  of the total \nmass shipped in Apple products in fiscal year 2023 contained \nrecycled content that is either supplier verified, meaning it has been \nreported by the supplier and cross-checked by Apple, or supplier \nreported, meaning it has been reported by the supplier based \non production and allocation values.
